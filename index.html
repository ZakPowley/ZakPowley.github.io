        		<h1>Zak Powley's Portfolio!</h1>
				<p> Most of my time in Software Engineering 2017 was spent working with Socket.IO, although
					 I started out helping with the bootstrap to make headers and footers for the page. I was
					asked to make a live response system working on the project server to get, and return data live 
					to the other pages. The end goal was to get newly added customers and their wanted meals to be displayed 
					on a seperate page (ViewCustomers) when the user put the details in, without the need of a refresh.
